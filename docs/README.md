### Audiences

üë∂ New user starting from scratch

- They have probably heard the term monorepo but don't really know what it is
- They're smart and eager to learn

üë∂ New user migrating an existing repo

- They know their framework of choice
- They know how npm workspaces work
- They're smart and eager to learn

üë¶ Intermediate User

- They know how to create an Nx repo or add Nx to an existing repo
- They have heard the terms integrated and package-based
- They know what a project is and how to make one
- They understand how to run a task and the basics of caching
- They can launch the graph
- They know that it is possible to enforce project boundaries

üë®‚Äçü¶≥ Advanced User

- They know everything about Nx except the specific piece of knowledge that is being taught by this document.

### Outline

* TODO:
- Getting Started -
  - These documents assume a new user and are generally concept guides with a lot of links to other parts of the site. 
  - There are some elements of recipes mixed in, but those should be kept to a minimum.
- Tutorials - 
  - These are tutorials written for a new user. 
  - After completing one of these tutorials, the user should have enough knowledge to be an intermediate user.
- Core Features - 
  - These are primarily recipes with a little concept mixed in. 
  - These documents should be short and provide the basic information that people will want 80% of the time and link to anything more complex. 
  - A new user should be able to click through these documents and skim them to get a good understanding of what Nx does without getting overwhelmed with details.
- Concepts - 
  - These are concept guides written for a new user. 
  - Any recipe content should be split into a recipe document and linked.
- More Concepts (or other categories under Concepts) - 
  - These are concept guides written for an intermediate user.
- Recipes - 
  - These are recipes written for an advanced user.
- Nx with Your Favorite Tech - 
  - These are tutorials written for an intermediate user.
  - Benchmarks - 
    - Reference documents linking to external resources.

## Markdown syntax available

The default markdown syntax is supported when writing documentation.

### Front matter

Front matter is used to add metadata to your Markdown file (`title` & `description`). 
It is provided at the very top of the file, enclosed by three dashes `---`. The content is parsed as `YAML`.

If no Front matter is detected, the metadata will be populated with the following:

- `title`: first main title detected
- `description`: first paragraph detected

```markdown
---
title: This is a custom title
description: This is a custom description
---
```

### Custom markdown syntax

* allows
  * adding functionality | its content
* uses
  * | [nx.dev](https://nx.dev) (== documentation website ) 

#### Callouts

Callouts are available to get the attention of the reader on some specific type of information.

```markdown
{% callout type="caution|check|note|warning" title="string" %}
Your content goes here.
{% /callout %}
```

#### Disclosure

A disclosure can be used for less important information that is initially collapsed.

```markdown
{% disclosure title="string" %}
Your content goes here.
{% /disclosure %}
```

#### Cards

Cards allow showing content in a grid system with a title, a description, a type and an url (internal/external).

```markdown
{% cards %}
{% card title="string" description="string" type="documentation|external|video" url="string" /%}
{% card title="string" description="string" type="documentation|external|video" url="string" /%}
// as many as cards you want
{% /cards %}
```

Title cards allow to only show a title in a card with a title and an url.

```markdown
{% cards cols="4" %}
{% title-card title="string" url="string" /%}
{% title-card title="string" url="string" /%}
{% title-card title="string" url="string" /%}
{% title-card title="string" url="string" /%}
{% /cards %}
```

#### Code

You can add specific languages and a filename on the code snippet displayed.

````
‚Äé```javascript {% fileName="main.js" %}
‚Äé const code = "goes here";
‚Äé```
````

#### Line Highlighting

You can define groups of lines that can be interactively highlighted to illustrate a point.

````
‚Äé```javascript {% lineGroups={ first:[2,3],second:[4,5] } %}
‚Äé const code = "goes here";
‚Äé This is in the first group
‚Äé This is also in the first group
‚Äé This is in the second group
‚Äé This is also in the second group
‚Äé```
````

The line groups can be highlighted using a button on the code fence itself, or by clicking on a link that you provide that changes the url fragment.

For example:

```
[This will highlight the first group.](#first)
```

You can also statically highlight a set of lines (the user won't be able to change what is highlighted):

````
‚Äé```javascript {% highlightLines=[2,3] %}
‚Äé const code = "goes here";
‚Äé This is highlighted
‚Äé This is also highlighted
‚Äé This is not highlighted
‚Äé Neither is this
‚Äé```
````

You can also specify ranges like `highlightLines=[2,3,"8-10"]`.

#### Terminal command

To display a terminal command, use:

````
‚Äé```shell
‚Äé npx nx build
‚Äé```
````

#### Terminal Output

You can display your terminal output with a dedicated component the same way you would show code.

````
‚Äé``` {% command="node index.js" %}
‚Äé My terminal output here!
‚Äé```
````

You can optionally also pass a `path` like

````
‚Äé``` {% command="node index.js" path="~/myorg" %}
‚Äé My terminal output here!
‚Äé```
````

#### Terminal Video Output

You can have a more dynamic visualization of a terminal output by using the following component:

```
{% terminal-video src="/documentation/shared/images/caching/cache-terminal-animation.mp4" /%}
```

#### Custom iframes

We can display a special iframe and setting its width inside the document.

```markdown
{% iframe
src="https://staging.nx.app/orgs/62d013d4d26f260059f7765e/workspaces/62d013ea0852fe0a2df74438?hideHeader=true"
title="Nx Cloud dashboard"
width="100%" /%}
```

If the type of the card is set to `type="video"` the `url` is a valid YouTube url, then the card will show a thumbnail of the video.

#### GitHub repositories

We can display a special button inviting the reader to go to a GitHub repository.

```markdown
{% github-repository url="https://github.com/nrwl/nx-examples" /%}
```

#### Stackblitz Buttons

You can add an "open in stackblitz" button as follows:

```markdown
{% stackblitz-button url="github.com/nrwl/nx-recipes/tree/main/angular-standalone?file=README.md" /%}
```

#### Install Nx Console

We can display a special button inviting the reader to go to a VSCode marketplace to install the official Nx plugin.

```markdown
{% install-nx-console /%}
```

#### Side by side

You can show content in a grid of 2 columns, via the `side-by-side` shortcode.

```markdown
{% side-by-side %}
You first content is here.

You second content is over here. _Note the space in between._
{% /side-by-side %}
```

#### Tabs

You can display multiple related information via a tabbing system.

```markdown
{% tabs %}
{% tab label="npm" %}
NPM related information.
{% /tab %}
{% tab label="yarn" %}
Yarn related information.
{% /tab %}
{% /tabs %}
```

##### Youtube

Embed a YouTube video directly with the following shortcode, control the title and the associated width. `src` can be the Youtube URL from the browser, the "share" button (short YT url) or the embed URL.

```markdown
{% youtube
src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rNImFxo9gYs"
title="Nx Console Run UI Form"
width="100%" /%}
```

#### Youtube Section Link

Have a more decent button-like widget that you can place below sections of a tutorial with a link to a specific point in a Youtube video.

```markdown
{% video-link link="https://youtu.be/OQ-Zc5tcxJE?t=64" /%}
```

#### Project Details View

Embed a Project Details View that is identical what is shown in Nx Console or `nx show project myproject --web`

````markdown
{% project-details title="Test" height="100px" %}

```json
{
  "project": {
    "name": "demo",
    "data": {
      "root": " packages/demo",
      "projectType": "application",
      "targets": {
        "dev": {

          }
        },
        "build": {

          "inputs": ["production", "^production"],
          "outputs": ["{projectRoot}/dist"],
          "options": {
            "command": "vite build"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "sourceMap": {
    "targets": ["packages/demo/vite.config.ts", "@nx/vite"],
    "targets.dev": ["packages/demo/vite.config.ts", "@nx/vite"],
    "targets.build": ["packages/demo/vite.config.ts", "@nx/vite"]
  }
}
```

{% /project-details %}
````

#### Graph

Embed an Nx Graph visualization that can be panned by the user.

````markdown
{% graph height="450px" %}

```json
{
  "projects": [
    {
      "type": "app",
      "name": "app-changed",
      "data": {
        "tags": ["scope:cart"]
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "lib",
